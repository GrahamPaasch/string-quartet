# string-quartet
A video game about interpersonal challeges faced by musicians of all kinds. 

I'm imagining this as a sort of adventure game. It's meant to be humorous. I want it to be from the perspective of the viola player. I'm hoping fans of Two Set Violin play the game.
I'm thinking top down isomorphic style, like ultima 6 or Disco Elysium. It's main inspiration is Disco Elysium. I'm imagining a lot of humorous game over situations, such as...

1. Someone is better than you. You were kicked out of the quartet and replaced by a 10 year old prodigy for your unacceptable performance on the and of beat 3 in measure 259. It's marked martele, idiot. Game over.
2. Nobody likes classical music. After your 100th volunteer gig at a local church, you literially die of starvation. Game over.
3. Your viola cost $100,000 and now it's broken. You can't afford to have it repaired. You simply don't have a Viola now. Game over.
4. Asshole 1st violin player. Your 1st violinist won't stop doing cocaine and being lewd with female, and male, booking agents. Game over.
5. Grad school. You are stuck in grad school. Game over.
6. Godel's rehearsal time incompleteness. The formal axiomatic theories of when each member of the quartet is available to rehearse are fundamentally unprovable within the system. No rehersals occur. Game over.
7. Bad performance. You butchered Pachelbel's cannon at a wedding. Game over.
8. Good performance. You become the greatest quartet of all time. You play so much that multiple nerves get pinched in your arms. Both your arms need to be amputated as a result. Game over.
9. Repertoire is too sad. After your 100th performance of the 8th String Quartet by Shostakovich your 2nd violinist surcumbs to depression and dies unexpectantly. Game over.
10. Cellist gets a job in tech. Realizing that a 3 month bootcamp on data science can lead to a 6-figure job, your cellist decides to quit music and becomes a successful and happy person working at Google, living in a large beautiful home with a lovely family. Their cello is seen in the background of every zoom call. Game over.
11. Authoritarianism. Any music not explicitly approved by the great authoritarian leader is banned. All string quartets are banned automatically. The leader did Suzuki and couldn't get past book 2. Game over.
12.
