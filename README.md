# string-quartet
A video game about interpersonal challeges faced by musicians of all kinds. 

I'm imagining this as a sort of adventure game. It's meant to be humorous. I want it to be from the perspective of the viola player. I'm hoping fans of Two Set Violin play the game.
I'm thinking top down isomorphic style, like ultima 6 or Disco Elysium. It's main inspiration is Disco Elysium. I'm imagining a lot of humorous game over situations, such as...

1. Someone is better than you. You were kicked out of the quartet and replaced by a 10 year old prodigy for your unacceptable performance on the and of beat 3 in measure 259. It's marked martele, idiot. Game over.
2. Nobody likes classical music. After your 100th volunteer gig at a local church, you literially die of starvation. Game over.
3. Your viola cost $100,000 and now it's broken. You can't afford to have it repaired. You simply don't have a Viola now. Game over.
4. Asshole 1st violin player. Your 1st violinist won't stop doing cocaine and being lewd with female, and male, booking agents. Game over.
5. Grad school. You are stuck in grad school. Game over.
6. Godel's rehearsal time incompleteness. The formal axiomatic theories of when each member of the quartet is available to rehearse are fundamentally unprovable within the system. No rehersals occur. Game over.
7. Bad performance. You butchered Pachelbel's cannon at a wedding. Game over.
8. Good performance. You become the greatest quartet of all time. You play so much that multiple nerves get pinched in your arms. Both your arms need to be amputated as a result. Game over.
9. Repertoire is too sad. After your 100th performance of the 8th String Quartet by Shostakovich your 2nd violinist surcumbs to depression and dies unexpectantly. Game over.
10. Cellist gets a job in tech. Realizing that a 3 month bootcamp on data science can lead to a 6-figure job, your cellist decides to quit music and becomes a successful and happy person working at Google, living in a large beautiful home with a lovely family. Their cello is seen in the background of every zoom call. Game over.
11. Authoritarianism. Any music not explicitly approved by the great authoritarian leader is banned. All string quartets are banned automatically. The leader did Suzuki and couldn't get past book 2. Game over.

Character profiles
1. Asian prodigy. You are young. You learned instantly at a glance every piece of music you ever heard or saw. You also play piano. Your parents are doctors. They are disappointed in you.
2. Competition winner. You nailed it at the Primrose competition. Congrats, you're hired!
3. Music school gremlin. You have 10 different kinds of music degrees for the 10 most prestigous music schools all over the world. You're in financial debt.
4. Privileged kid. You went to Curtis at age 5. You weren't very good. Your father was often frusturated teaching you and even thought carefully at times about whether it was appropriate for him to be privileging his own children in this manner.
5. Random person out of the blue that plays better than everyone else. Who are you? Nobody knows. Do you even know? You're so generic looking. You look like any random person off the street. Why do you play so well? It's so weird. Where did you come from? What? I've never heard of that.
6. Legendary player... who is 100+ years old. In your hayday you gave William Primrose a run for his money. You were his backup for many critical performances. The only reason you weren't any bigger is because your name isn't as memorable. People kept butchering it. You were a way better viola player. His death of old age 30 years ago really saddened you, now 50 years later, you carry in your Viola case a picture of the two of you together, right next to the photo of yourself next to Abraham Lincoln.
7. Asshole. You're just good. Okay. We get it. You're good. Geez.
8. Idiot savant. There's drool on your copy of the 24 Paganini Caprices, transcribed for Viola. You learned it all in one night then broke your Viola by bashing it on your head. You now always have to wear a helmet.
9. Tragic accident. You were burned alive, lost your legs in a subway incident, or barely survied polio as a kid. To cope, you practice. You practice a lot.
10. Hilbilly. Vyola' sure is perty. Lisen to dis, uhuh, little fiddle tune here. * Plays all 41 campagnoli caprices flawlessly back to back *
11. The person who did all the right things. You kind of suck honestly.
